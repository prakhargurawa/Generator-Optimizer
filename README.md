# Generator-Optimizer
Given a set of 10 generators ( Hydro-electricity, Solid fuel, Gas and Solar) we need to opearate the generators at minimum cost considering different constraints.

The constraints are as follows:

The energy produced by each generator per hour should be in range of lower and upper bounds.
The energy produced by solid fuel per hour is constant.
The total energy produced per hour should match with demand of city.
The efficieny of solar energy varies from hour to hour.
